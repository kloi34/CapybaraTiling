# CapybaraTiling
This is a webpage that generates a colorful tiling of capybaras. Capybaras are colored uniquely each time the page loads.

The tiling should fill the whole screen on most(?) screen sizes (if you dont zoom out or scroll).

This page exists because
1. I'm practicing JavaScript and
2. I need a capybara background that looks cool

This project is dedicated to Aya, a capybara enthusiast.
